# Minetest-KetchupLand
KetchupLand's fork of the Minetest voxel engine.

Building Minetest-KetchupLand is very similar to building Minetest, but you will need to clone the KetchupLand game into `games/`. If you're running in place, you can do this by running the following command:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/KetchupLand/KetchupLand games/ketchupland
```

The rest of the instructions are identical to Minetest, see [README-minetest.md](README-minetest.md).
